# arangodb-cugraph-hackathon
My Submission for the ArangoDB-CuGraph Hackathon


The main submission file is: [Top_Physics_Researchers.ipynb](Top_Physics_Researchers.ipynb)

[MakeNetwork.ipynb] contains some dataset setup work.

## Inspiration
I am inspired by the work of my [research Group](https://networkinequality.com/).  The study of complexity science and sociology requires a lot of network science, but I found very few scientists and sociologists using graph databases, which puzzled me.

## What it does
My agent provides a dashboard geared towards science of science insights in the domain of physics: who wrote papers, which researchers collaborated together, which topics are found in which country etc.

## How we built it
I basically leveraged a lot of the multi-model functionality of arangoDB, including full-text search and of course the graph database functionality

## Challenges we ran into
Lanchain is new to me, so it was quite a struggle getting it to behave

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm glad to be using new technologies in a field that relies so much on raw networkX.  I can't wait to introduce it to my team
